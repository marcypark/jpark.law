Frequently-asked questions and essays on law and related topics

Here are my attempts to answer common questions about the law in California and in the
United States, liberally sprinkled with my opinions.

**Please note:** Because I have not had the opportunity to consult with you regarding your specific situation, you should NOT take what follows as constituting legal advice, or as presenting up-to-date and accurate information, and you should NOT rely on it.

Instead, the summaries here are meant to give you a general understanding of the workings of and the rationale behind the laws which affect us, thereby helping you prepare for consulting with an attorney. Think of it as learning the alphabet at home before enrolling in elementary school to go on to reading and writing.

## What is the law? The basics.

1. Who makes laws?

   Unlike in dictatorships or in religion, in a democracy like ours the laws are made by elected representatives. In other words, by us.

2. What laws are we subject to?

   Due to the U.S.'s special political structure, we are subject to two sets of laws:

   a. federal (bankruptcy, copyright, the Constitution)

   b. state (family, probate, criminal, etc).

3. If it's a matter of simply obeying the law, why do we need lawyers?

   a. Judges and jury members are human beings, and therefore limited in their ability to arrive at justice. So, the best we can do is the adversarial system, where lawyers on either side give it their best shot to convince the finder of fact that their client is right. Yes, it is an advanced form of Thunderdome.

   b. Law is not magic or automatic. A signed contract, for example, can be set aside if it was obtained through fraud or duress, or goes against public policy.

## Family law: in divorce, you always win.

1. Why?

   The policy of the state of California is to honor the wishes of individuals to divorce due to irreconcilable differences. So, once you have arrived at your decision at the religious and philosophical level, the state will not hold you back, regardless of whose fault it is, regardless of who's a better spouse or better parent.

2. So does fault matter at all?

   Not for divorce itself. But domestic violence can have an effect on child custody, spousal support, and property division.

3. What's the key principle in child custody and visitation?

   Welfare of the children.

4. For property division?

   What is acquired during marriage is community property (divided equally).

5. How long does divorce take?

   Six months to many years if it is contested. Fastest is if husband and wife reach settlement. There is also expedited processing in emergencies, and you can also ask the court to divorce you first, and settle child custody and prop division later.

6. What's the best, cheapest way?

   Settlement. Fastest. Less stress. The courts want you to settle. If contested, attorney's fees can sometimes eat up most or all the property. The key is to find an attorney who is cost-conscious and pursues settlement possibilities, rather than unlimited litigation and consequent billing.

7. After divorce?

   Take good care of your children. Live well.

## Estate planning: are you ready?

1. Why do you need a will?

   a. If there is no will at death, the state will dispose of your property according to its default priorities. For example, everything will go to your surviving spouse, but if no spouse is surviving, to your surviving children, and if no children, then to your siblings. But you may not agree with this order. This is where a will comes in: you can make specific instructions on when, how, and to whom to give away your property.

   b. Without a will, the legal process of distribution of property (i.e. probate) can go many months, even years. This is because the deceased's wishes are not clear and distribution may be contested.

2. What's the best way to simplify things after your death?

   In addition to making a will, you can often avoid probate altogether by pre-disposing your assets in the following ways:

   a. For real estate, you can add the intended recipient to the title as joint tenant with right of survivorship. This means that upon your death, the property automatically goes to that person.

   b. Similarly, with many bank accounts, insurance, and similar holdings, you can add the intended recipients as a death beneficiary.

   c. You can transfer your major assets to a living trust, so that at your death, the successor trustee automatically controls the property.

   NB: there may be important tax consequences to all these actions; you should consult with a tax attorney.

3. Other benefits of a will and trust?

   Besides avoiding or shortening probate, you can specify exactly what you wish. For example: if the heirs are minors, you can stipulate that your property not be given to them immediately, but put in care of a trustee until a time when the heirs are older and, it is to be hoped, more mature.

4. What if you become senile or otherwise incompetent before death?

   With a durable power of attorney, someone else can make decisions regarding, for example, your business affairs or health care. You can specify the specific conditions under which such a power of attorney becomes effective.

5. Anything else?

   Distributing everything (by gift, will, or trust) before death is risky — cf. King Lear (or Kurosawa's Ran), where the father is miserable and abused, having already given away everything to his children. But I think it is better to meet the sunset of life happily with less, than to cower in fear and paranoia.

## Business contracts: for many, it is already too late.

In all areas of law, but especially in business, a lawyer should review your documents before you write your check.

1. Why should a lawyer review your business contracts in advance?

   a. A lawyer can research the background of the other parties for a history of fraud, negligence, or just bad business.

   b. A lawyer can review the contracts to make sure that the documents correctly reflect your understanding and preserve all your rights.

   c. A lawyer can make sure that your contract is valid.

2. What are some things I should watch out for to make sure that a document preserves my rights?

   a. that it clearly spells out the important terms: what I give, what I get in return, when and how these transactions happen.

   b. that it says what happens when someone breaks the contract: e.g. penalties, cancellation.

   c. that whoever wrongly breaks the contract is liable for attorney's fees and other costs to make things right.d. that if there is a lawsuit, it is subject to the laws and courts of the place where you live, e.g. California.

3. What are some things that can make a contract unenforceable?

   a. it has an unlawful purpose: e.g. to buy and sell illegal drugs.

   b. it is clearly and seriously unfair to one side: e.g. if A breaks the contract, the penalty is $20, but if B breaks it, it is $1000.

   c. fraud. duresse. natural disasters

4. What else should you think about in a business contract and lawsuit?

   a. Even if you are right, it often costs more to sue.

   b. Even if you win, if the other side just hides or files for bankruptcy, then you will likely have wasted time and money.

These are just general principles. Only consulting with a good lawyer, preferably in advance, can give you accurate advice that you can rely on. Such a determination can be obtained for a very small fraction of the amount of money involved in a business project.

## Lawsuit: it's a long, hard journey.

It's easy to threaten "I'll sue!" but in reality there are many stages to think about.

1. Plaintiff files Complaint

   The main purpose is to state facts in order to give the defendant notice of what he is being sued for.

   a. identify the person suing, the person sued, and why the court location is proper.

   b. describe the specific claims, e.g. breach of contract, fraud

   c. describe what you seek, e.g. money, completion of work, stay-away orderd. court filing fee is about $450 per plaintiff; each defendant will have to pay the same to respond to the complaint

2. Plaintiff serves Summons and Complaint

   This is the actual delivery of the lawsuit to the defendant, which starts the clock ticking.

   a. done in-person, mail, or even by publication in a newspaper if the defendant is evasive

   b. after service, defendant normally has 30 days to respond

3. Defendant responds to Complaint

   a. answer: basically denying all the allegations of the Complaint (substance), or

   b. demurrer: arguing that the Complaint is not proper (form). The judge will rule on this question and order the Plaintiff to revise his complaint, or dismiss the Complaint entirely, or order the defendant to answer the Complaint.

   c. If Defendant does not respond at all, then Plaintiff can get default and default judgment against defendant, and start the (long) process of collections.

4. Share DiscoveryEach party requests and gives information about the lawsuit to the other party, to be used in trial.

   a. Written requests, and also depositions (oral questioning).

   b. Except in a few situations, all information and documents that relate to the lawsuit must be shared

   c. If one party refuses, the other can ask the judge for an order, as well as penalties.

5. Conduct TrialThis is what we normally see in the movies. Ironically, more than 90% of cases settle before this stage. The costs of a trial are high, due to attorney fees and other costs like expert witnesses and stenographers.

   a. prepare evidence

   b. select jury

   c. present evidence (e.g. documents, testimony) to jury

   d. jury decides and judge confirms

6. Other considerations?

   a. The basic policies behind these procedures are: 1. justice 2. efficiency.

   b. At any time during the above process, you can settle. Often it is during discovery, when the costs become clear and you have enough information to determine the probable outcome.

   c. It is well worth hiring a competent attorney, not only to pursue a lawsuit, but also advise you when to settle.

## Attorney-client relationship: do you trust me?

Trust in both directions is a necessary foundation of your relationship with your attorney.

1. Why is trust necessary?.

   a. When clients don't trust, the attorney has less confidence in the client's case and therefore is less effective.

   b. The opposition can find out things that the client did not tell her attorney, and the attorney therefore did not prepare against. This can be catastrophic.

   c. Your side looks disorganized and divided.

   d. Time is wasted.

   e. The entire purpose of hiring an attorney is an exchange of work for payment. If the client continues to worry and micromanage, she is paying, and does the work herself as well — a bad business deal.

2. How does the law protect clients who trust attorneys?

   Similar to a physician's oath which absolutely protects the patient, a lawyer is bound by fiduciary duties.

   a. Attorneys must be completely loyal to their client's interests. They cannot do or say anything which harms their clients. That is why they cannot normally represent opposite parties in a case; they need special permission from the client even when there is merely a possibility of conflict of interest. Also, attorneys cannot overcharge their clients, or insist on unnecessary work. They must also communicate regularly with the client.

   b. Attorneys must have basic legal skills. If the attorney is clearly incompetent, a client can make a claim for malpractice.

   c. Communication between attorney and client for the purpose of legal advice is confidential. With few exceptions (e.g. client using advice for future crime), the attorney cannot disclose it. The reason, of course, is that this society encourages clients to be completely honest with their attorneys, and thereby receive the best representation possible. Some attorneys hear more confessions than priests or ministers or psychologists.

3. Is this a unilateral relationship of trust?

   No, attorneys have the need to trust their clients as well:

   a. that they will tell them the whole truth.

   b. that they will cooperate in the case fully. Sometimes it is embarrassing to the judge and opposing attorneys when one's client does not respond to communication or does not provide needed documents.

   c. that they will be reasonable in their expectations.

   d. that they will pay their attorney bills. Attorneys are in a vulnerable position because they must often get the judge's permission before dropping a client.

   e. If a client breaks the attorney's trust, the attorney will probably refuse to work for her in the future.

4. How do you find an attorney you can trust?

   a. Ask people that you know.

   b. Speak to several attorneys. Not just for free advice, or to "test" their knowledge, but to see what kind of person they are.

   c. Start with a small matter first, to see how they do the work and treat you.

## Defamation: watch your tongue (and pen)!

Defamation law is a balance between free speech and not hurting others.

1. What do you need to sue for slander?

   a. a person said (or wrote) something to another

   b. about you

   c. that was false, or the speaker failed to use reasonable care in determining the truth/falsity of of the statement

   d. the statement caused you to sufferhatred, contempt, ridicule, or shame or to discourage others from associating or dealing with you.

   e. and you suffered as to your property, business, or occupation.

2. What remedy can you get?

   a. payment for harm to your business, occupation

   b. payment for harm to your reputation

   c. payment for harm to your embarrassment, shame, and hurt feelings.

   d. punitive damages (multiple of the above) if speaker acted with malice

3. What limitations are there in defamation law?

   a. public figures have less protection because they already have widespread attention

   b. defamation is generally limited to factual statements, not opinions: e.g. "He is a crook" vs. "I believe he is a crook."

   c. truth, of course, is a defense (see 1c, above).

4. What are related causes of action?

   a. Public Disclosure of Private Facts: e.g. publicize pictures of a person's grisly death

   b. Intrusion into Private Matters, e.g. go into a person's home to record a private conversation

   c. Misappropriation of Person's Name or Likeness: e.g. commercial use of a person's picture without permission

   d. Portraying a Person in a False Light: e.g. publicize pictures of innocent persons with headline "Criminals arrested" (i.e. it does not explicitly say that they are criminals, but the natural implication is there).

5. How do you stop a person for defaming you?

   a. formal demand in writing, perhaps through a lawyer

   b. file a lawsuit for defamation

   c. while lawsuit is pending, ask the judge for a temporary (emergency) and preliminary (until end of trial) injunction to stop the person from defaming you. If you win trial, you also get a permanent injunction.

   d. The beginning point of all this is to discuss the problem and the costs in time / money / stress with a knowledgeable attorney.

## Business entities: who are you?

Different business entities offer a balance of benefits and liabilities.

1. Why do some people use business entities?

   a. privacy

   b. limiting liability: when something bad happens, the entity, not the individual, is responsible

   c. tax reasons

2. What kinds of business entities (i.e. the identity you use to do business) are there?Starting from simplest to most complicated, they are:

   a. self: Gimli's gardening service. No privacy. Gimli is responsible personally for everything bad that might happen because of his business activities. Gimli simply pays taxes on his income.

   b. partnership: Gimli & Galadriel's Gardening Service. No privacy. Gimli & Galadrielare personally responsible for everything bad that might happen because of their business activities. Gimli & Galadriel simply pay taxes, individually, for the income each one receives from the partnership business.

   c. corporation: GG Gardening Inc. Some privacy, since it takes a little effort to find out who are the owners. If something bad happens in the business, only the corporation is liable, but the individuals are USUALLY not liable. However, corporations suffer double taxation: both the corporation itself, and its individual shareholders / employees have to pay taxes.

   d. limited liability company (LLC): GG Gardening LLC. The same privacy as a corporation. The same liability protection as a corporation. However, it USUALLY is not subject to double taxation as with corporation. This "best of both worlds" is why many people choose the LLC entity.

3. What is a dba?

   "Doing business as." This is just the name under which any entity can do business. For example, GG Gardening Inc. (a corporation) can do business as "Forever Green." Or Gimli & Galadriel's Gardening Service (a partnership) can do business as "Hometown Gardening." The dba has little legal significance.

4. What are some requirements/limitations of liability protection in corporations and LLCs?

   a. criminal, intentional, or grossly negligent acts/omissions are usually not protected

   b. properly register the entity with the state. This gives notice to potential customers, so that they know, e.g. if they're dealing with a corporation/LLC, that they cannot normally sue the individuals if something goes wrong.

   c. maintain proper decision-making, record-keeping, and operations.

   d. keep the individual entirely separate from the corporation, especially in finances. For example, if you use the corporation/LCC as a piggy bank, then people can sue the individual as well, claiming that the individual / entity distinction is invalid.

5. How do you set up a business entity?

   Do-it-yourself kits might be cheap at first, but if you do not fully understand the reason for registering, and how to properly maintain the entity, then you are not really saving money. The best way is to speak to a competent attorney to discuss your business needs first. The process takes at least a few weeks.

## Trademark registration: protect your name.

1. What is a trademark and what is its purpose?

   It is a mark of letters or symbols which identifies a company or its goods and services.It helps to prevent others from using the same mark to make customers believe that others are the same as you. E.g. I cannot start a computer company named "apple."

2. So, whoever registers first gets the trademark?

   Not necessarily. Prior usage, among other factors, is also important.

3. What happens if someone else uses my trademark?

   If, after you demand they stop, they continue, you can sue them in federal court for damages.

4. Do you have to be using the trademark already, to register it?

   No. You can have an intent to use in commerce.

5. How long does it take?

   If the initial application is approved, others have six months to oppose. After that, you submit evidence of actual usage. Thereafter, you are awarded the trademark.

6. Can I do it without a lawyer?

   Yes, it is possible. But an attorney can navigate for you the tricky deadlines of registration, as well as advise you of its benefits and limitations. This can help to prevent future expense, for example, in litigation.

## Miscellanea

In law, as in life, being reasonable and informed is key.

1. In an accident, do I have to keep my car exactly where it crashed until I get a police report?

   No. You should get out of the flow of traffic, unless prevented by injury or vehicle condition.

2. Can a lawyer help you to fight a traffic ticket?

   Only in some cases where you have clear proof to support you. Even so, the money you save is usually not worth the attorney's fees. Drive carefully.

3. After drinking, is it okay to sleep it off in your car?

   A taxi is better. If a policeman sees you in the car, he can begin a DUI investigation. If you have no choice, then it is better to hide the keys and sleep in the back seat. But this is still not a guarantee.

4. Someone wronged me. Can I and should I sue them?

   Only if

   a. reasonable settlement efforts are futile

   b. and the law recognizes your claim. E.g. there is normally no relief for "injured pride" or "business competition."

   c. and you have solid evidence to support your sided. and you are confident that you can collect your award.

5. If I am required to buy health insurance under Obamacare and I don't buy it, what is the penalty?

   a. for 2014, it is the greater of $95 per person or 1% of income, taken with your tax return.

   b. Not everybody is required to buy health insurance, so you should find out your specific situation.

   c. For some people, it may be a good decision to buy health insurance at this time.

6. Is it illegal to take the label off when you buy a mattress?

   Only if you are a reseller. As a consumer, you can do whatever you want. The law was made to insure quality and health safety for the mattress industry. Rest easy.
